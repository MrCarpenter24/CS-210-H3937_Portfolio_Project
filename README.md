# CS-210-H3937_Portfolio_Project
This project establishes the first project of a work portfolio under the Southern New Hampshire University computer science program. Established during term 21EW3 (February 7, 2021).

Functionality:
PhillipsClockApp, a revised version of the class's initial Project One, can give a live read of the system time. The program also allows the user to make adjustments to what is being displayed.

Questions to Answer for my Instructor:

What did you do particularly well?
  I wouldn't say that I did it well, no, but I was able to take an example program (linked in the code) of code I had never used nor 
  seen before and figure out how it works, as well as how to make it work for my project.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I wanted to improve the interface with box drawing characters but CMD wasn't able to read them correctly and I knew it woud take a 
  lot of time to sort that one out. I also wanted my code to be seperated into various files for readability and so the compiler  
  wouldn't have to compile ever line again after an edit. I tried sorting that out and, though they're short, I would've had to   
  completely change how my functions operated.
  
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  It was all challenging. I felt very in the dark with the clock functionality. I was given a different example peice from the one I 
  used and I really didn't like it as well. The output was not as similar to what I was trying to accomplish as it needed to be, thus 
  I found another example with even more parts that needed figured out. Lots andn lots of reading on online forums as well as 
  video watching and tutorial reading has been done.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  This project really taught some pateince, it taught me how to sort and keep track of several working parts in my head, and I'm 
  certain I'd be a better problem solver too. Particularly to those last to, I was able to build on my ability to keep track of an 
  manage both the "big" and "little" parts of the "picture". Variable scope and just seeing where things are or aren't being 
  changed/manipulated is a semi-decent way to describe this.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Since I didn't split the program into various files like I had wanted to I made sure to have plenty of comments, some of which 
  may needediting but they're beyond descriptive enough. I did make sure to be consistent in my use of whitespace and especially 
  to indenting. There's nothing more annoying than pasting code and it just doesn't automaticaly indent correctly.
